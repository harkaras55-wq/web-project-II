    <h1>My Poetic Journey</h1>
    <img src="project33.jpg" width="400px">
    <p>I have been writing since I was a child. Back then, poetry was simply my quiet space—a place where I could
        express what I didn't know how to say out loud. My words were small, personal, and meant only for myself.</p>


    <p>But everything changed when I reached class 8.
        There was an incident that brought me closer to someone, and for the first time, someone actually asked me to
        write for her. That one request changed the meaning of poetry in my life.
        What used to be just my habit slowly turned into something deeper, because now I was writing for her—because she
        wanted it, because she inspired it, and because something inside me wanted to give her the words she was waiting
        for. </p>

    <p> From that moment, my poetry carried a new kind of feeling.
        My lines were no longer just thoughts—they were messages, emotions, and unsaid truths for someone special. She
        became the reason behind many of my verses, the muse behind the emotions I poured into every page.</p>

    <p> And even though life moved forward and things changed,
        I never stopped writing.
        The journey that began with her request stayed alive inside me. I continued writing—sometimes for the memories,
        sometimes for the emotions, and sometimes just to keep myself connected to everything I once felt.</p>

    <img src="projectt.jpg" width="400px">
    <p>She is not with me anymore,
        but my poems are still for her.
        Every word I write meets her memories again and again—
        a quiet way to connect myself to her,
        even when she is no longer here,but I know that she still sees my writing which I posts on social media.</p>
